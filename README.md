A program to quickly make macros which can be image detection based. This is an old version, if you wish to run the program via a terminal. There are some minor bugs that have been caught already and may be more that I'm (Nokov) not aware of, but this version is not being updated so they have and most likely will not be patched.

Use main if you want a GUI.
